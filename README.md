Simple cookie expiration to mitigate the risk of stolen cookies.

## Description ##

According to wewatchyourwebsite.com, around 60% of hacked WordPress sites in 2023 were due to stolen cookie sessions, not plugin or theme vulnerabilities.
I've created this function to automatically expire your session cookie after a defined amount of inactivity.


## Installation ##

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

e.g.

1. Upload `er-expire-user-cookie` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
